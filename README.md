# linear-regression-comparison

This Jupyter Notebook file compares two implementations of linear regression: one implemented from scratch and the other using scikit-learn.

## Overview

The purpose of this notebook is to provide a side-by-side comparison of a manual implementation of linear regression and the scikit-learn library's implementation. Users can explore the differences in code, understand the underlying concepts, and compare the performance of the two approaches.

## File

- **linear_regression_comparison.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing both implementations.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the notebook:

1. Open the `linear_regression_comparison.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Execute the cells in sequential order.
3. Compare the results, code, and performance of the linear regression implementations.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of linear regression.

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
